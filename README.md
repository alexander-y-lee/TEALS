# :mortar_board: About

This project contains 3 files: main.py, object_helper.py, primitive_helper.py

## :pushpin: Usage

There are 3 questions inside main.py that needs to be answered

## :clipboard: Basic Terminologies

    '''''' or # are comments for human eyes only, computer will not act on them

    CLASS = blueprint, or a design plan

    VARIABLE = a container, or a bucket

    FUNCTION() = a collection of steps, or instructions; has () next to them

    PARAMETERS = the values or data the function is supposed to take or be given

    ARGUMENTS = the values or data being passed or given when calling the function

    LIST = a collection of values or data, stored as elements and accessed with indices

    INDEX = used to access the elements inside a list; starts at 0

    RETURN = gives you back something

    PRINT = literally just writes something on the TV (console/terminal) for human eyes only

    . (DOT) = used to access properties of classes or objects

    PROPERTIES = any data or values belonging to a class or specific object

    IMPORT = used to gain access (scope) to other files (classes or modules)

    SCOPE = the visibility (who can access) of a variable, function, or class; local scope has higher priority than global scope

## :clipboard: Two Types of Data

### :bookmark_tabs: Objects and Primitives

    OBJECT  = anything created (instantiated) from a class

    PRIMITIVE = copies of pre-defined concepts (ints, float, double, strings, char, boolean); You can also think of them as "lego building blocks" or molecules, IE: the numeric value 10 is the same no matter where you go

## :clipboard: Memory of data types

### :bookmark_tabs: Stack and Heap

    STACK = temporary space for variables and function calls

    HEAP = permanent space for objects to live

### :bookmark_tabs: Object Data Types Examples

    list: ["Hello", "World"], where elements have ordering (arranged in a line, starting from index 0)

### :bookmark_tabs: Primitive Data Types

    Strings: "Hello World"

    Integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    Floats: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0

    Booleans: True, False
